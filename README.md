# Machine Learning Models


Main focus of this repo is to have implementation of various ML algoriths from scratch. It will be helpful for someone who wants not only wants to conceptually and intuitively understand various algos, but also learn how to code them. 
  
* [01_Gradient_Boosting_Scratch.ipynb](notebooks/01_Gradient_Boosting_Scratch.ipynb)
This jupyter notebook has implementation of basic gradient boosting algorithm with an intuitive example. Learn about decision tree and intuition behind gradient boositng trees.

*  [02_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb](notebooks/02_Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb)
Builting MovieLens recommendation system with collaborating filtering using PyTorch and fast.ai.

* [03_Random_Forest_Interpretetion.ipynb](notebooks/03_Random_Forest_Interpretetion.ipynb)
How to interpret a seemimngly blackbox algorithm. Feature importance, Tree interpretor and Confidence intervals for predictions.

* [04_Neural_Net_Scratch.ipynb](notebooks/04_Neural_Net_Scratch.ipynb)
Using MNSIT data, this notebook has implementation of neural net from scratch using PyTorch.

* [05_Loss_Functions.ipynb	](notebooks/05_Loss_Functions.ipynb	)
Exploring regression and classification loss functions. 
  
* [06_NLP_Fastai.ipynb](notebooks/06_NLP_Fastai.ipynb)
